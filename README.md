# WARNING!

This code is very buggy. the implementation is trash, it makes your computer freeze, it skips multiple songs out of nowhere, it crashes out of nowhere, and the feature set is honestly minimal. Please, don't use this unless you're a developer who knows what they're doing and can solve it. I will probably re-write it and fix most of the problems and add new features someday, but that'll have to wait until I have spare time. so, just don't use it. :)
